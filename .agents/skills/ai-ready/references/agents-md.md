# AGENTS.md Reference

What belongs in `AGENTS.md`, what does not, and where the rest goes. Read this in Step 2.

## The discoverability test, worked case by case

SKILL.md states the rule: can the agent find this by reading the code? If yes, don't write it down. Here's how
that lands on the sections people generate anyway:

| Commonly generated | Verdict |
|---|---|
| A directory tree of `src/`, `tests/`, `docs/` | **Cut.** The agent can list the directory |
| A statement of the language or framework | **Cut.** The manifest says so |
| An architecture summary restating the file layout | **Cut.** Same information, stale within a month |
| A data-model summary | **Cut.** It can read `schema.prisma` |
| Build, test and lint **commands** | **Keep.** Often buried in tooling config, and needed every task |
| *Why* the layout is unusual — a directory that is not what it looks like | **Keep.** Not discoverable |
| Conventions mined from PR reviews | **Keep.** Exists nowhere in the code |
| The maintenance matrix | **Keep.** Cross-file coupling is the hardest thing to infer |
| `## Done means` / `## Never merges without a human` | **Keep.** Decisions, not facts |

## Two rules with no room for judgment

- **State the positive rule, never the prohibition.** Write `Use the v2 client in lib/api/`, not `Do not use
  the v1 client`. Naming a deprecated thing makes the model more likely to reach for it, not less.
- **Never state the same convention in two files. Do split by scope.** A rule that only applies to
  `packages/api/` belongs in `packages/api/AGENTS.md`.

## Where everything else goes

Four placements, in order. Ask "how often is this needed?" and put it at the first one that fits.

| Needed | Goes in | Why |
|---|---|---|
| On **every** task | Root `AGENTS.md` | This is what the root file is for, and the only thing it is for |
| Only in one area of the repo | A **nested `AGENTS.md`** in that directory | Loaded only when work happens there |
| Only when performing one procedure | A **skill** (`.github/skills/`, Step 4d) | Loaded when its description matches the task |
| Rarely, or as lookup material | A linked doc in `docs/` | Read on demand, costs nothing until then |

**Nested `AGENTS.md` is part of the standard, not a workaround.** Agents walk up the directory tree from the
file being edited and combine every `AGENTS.md` they find, with the **closest one winning** on conflicts. This
is the intended way to scale: OpenAI's main repository carries dozens of them.

So for a monorepo, per-area conventions belong in `packages/<area>/AGENTS.md`, not in a growing root file. The
root keeps only what is true everywhere.

## Report this honestly

If the repo's existing `AGENTS.md` is well past the 20–30 line target, say so with the number and name the
sections that could move. Do not rewrite it unasked — the same Do No Harm rule applies here as everywhere else.

Never delete something load-bearing to hit a number. If a section can't move because it genuinely applies to
every task, it stays — say so in the report rather than quietly trimming something useful.

## Generating the two sections

**`## Done means`** — the conditions a change must meet before it is finished.

**There is no template. Derive all three to five lines from this repo**, in this order:

1. **The verify command.** Find the command a maintainer runs before pushing — in this repo's task runner,
   script block, or CI workflow, whichever it uses. Name it exactly as it is written there. If the repo runs
   several, name them in order. If it has none, skip this line rather than inventing one.
2. **The test condition.** *Any behavior change ships with a test that fails without the change.* This is the
   only line that applies to every repo that has tests, so include it wherever tests exist.
3. **The contract line, only if this repo publishes something others depend on.** A schema, an interface
   definition, a public type — whatever this repo's consumers build against. Most repos publish nothing of the
   kind. Omit rather than invent.

Stop at five. A longer list is a checklist nobody finishes.

**`## Never merges without a human`** — the boundary. `## Done means` is the other half and is often mistaken
for the same thing: `## Done means` is what a change must satisfy to be **finished**; this is what it cannot
decide **alone**. A change can be done and still be on this list.

**Always write the definition into the generated file**, directly under the heading, exactly as in the template
below. The heading alone is ambiguous and *will* be challenged — "I tell agents to merge when they're done, is
that banned?" is the first question anyone asks. It is not banned: the definition draws the line at whether a
person read *this diff*, so standing approval stays fine everywhere off the list.

Seed the list from the risk paths actually present in this repo (see [detection-tables.md](detection-tables.md) § Risk path detection, generated
from [../data/risk-paths.yml](../data/risk-paths.yml)), then state each as a path or a condition rather than a
category.

**Before you write a line, check it against [`../data/risk-paths.yml`](../data/risk-paths.yml) § `false_positives`.** Those are not
hypothetical — every entry is a line this skill actually got wrong in a real repo. If what you matched appears
there, answer the row's `confirm` question by opening the file, and drop the line unless the answer holds up.
That list is the one part of this step with a regression test behind it
(`tests/fixtures/`), so treat a match as a stop sign rather than a hint:

```markdown
## Never merges without a human

A person has to have **read this diff** before it lands. Telling an agent "merge it when you're done" is
approving a goal, not this change — so it does not count for anything on this list. Everywhere else it counts
fine, which is the point of having a list.

- Anything under `db/migrations/`
- Anything that changes the shape of an existing API response
- Anything that sends messages to customers
- Anything that grants or changes permissions
```

Only list risk paths this repo actually has — a static site has no migrations, and inventing categories to
fill the section is the noise this skill exists to avoid. If the analysis finds none, say so explicitly in one
line rather than omitting the heading.
