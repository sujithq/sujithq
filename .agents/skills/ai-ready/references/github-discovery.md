# GitHub Discovery Reference

Detailed API calls and techniques for Step 0 — GitHub-native context discovery.

## 0b. Fetch repo metadata from GitHub

Use the GitHub MCP tools (if available) or `gh` CLI to pull rich context the user should never have to explain:

| What to fetch | Tool / Command | What you learn |
|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| Repo description, topics, visibility, default branch | `github-mcp-server-get_file_contents` on `/` or `gh repo view --json description,topics,isPrivate,primaryLanguage,defaultBranchRef --jq '.' | cat` | What this project is about, how it's categorized, default branch name |
| Language breakdown | `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/languages | cat` (bash) | Accurate language percentages (better than guessing from files) |
| Community health | `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/community/profile | cat` (bash) | Which community files exist (CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, license, issue templates) — GitHub already knows this |
| Contributors | `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/contributors --jq '.[].login' | cat` (bash) | Team size, contribution patterns |
| Open issues | `github-mcp-server-list_issues` or `gh issue list | cat` | Active problems, what the project cares about |
| Recent merged PRs | `gh pr list --state merged --limit 10 --json title,body,files | cat` (bash) | Contribution patterns — what files get touched together, what a typical PR looks like |
| PR review comments | `github-mcp-server-pull_request_read` on recent PRs | **Repeated review feedback = conventions that should be in `AGENTS.md`** |
| Releases | `gh release list --limit 5 | cat` (bash) | Release cadence, versioning scheme |
| GitHub Actions workflows | `github-mcp-server-actions_list` or read `.github/workflows/` | CI/CD setup, what runs on PRs |
| Branch protection | `github-mcp-server-list_branches` | Default branch, protection rules |
| Push permissions | `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo} --jq '.permissions.push' | cat` (bash) | Whether the user can push directly or needs to fork |

## 0c. PR review mining details

Look at the 5-10 most recent merged PRs. If a maintainer leaves the same review comment on multiple PRs,
that's a convention waiting to be documented.

**Mine agent review comments too, not just human ones.** Review threads are no longer only humans correcting
humans. Coding agents open pull requests and review agents comment on them, and both are part of how this
repo's standards actually get applied now. Treat every reviewer as a source, and record which kind each rule
came from — an agent repeating itself means a rule is missing from `AGENTS.md`, which is a slightly different
signal than a human repeating themselves.

1. Use `github-mcp-server-list_pull_requests` (state: closed, sort: updated) to find recent merged PRs
2. For each, use `github-mcp-server-pull_request_read` (method: get_review_comments) to read review threads
3. Look for **repeated patterns** — the same feedback given across multiple PRs becomes a convention:
   - "Please add tests for this" → add to test conventions
   - "Use X pattern instead of Y" → add to coding conventions
   - "Update the docs when you change this" → add to maintenance matrix
   - "Don't forget to update the changelog" → add to maintenance matrix

4. **Read the history as an evolution, not a flat list.** Conventions change, and a rule mined from two years
   ago may have been deliberately abandoned. Weight what you find:
   - Comments from the **most recent third** of the PRs you read count double.
   - A pattern that appears **early and then stops** is a candidate for *superseded* — do not write it as a
     current rule. Note it in the findings so the user can confirm, e.g. _"Reviewers asked for X until
     March and stopped — dropped, confirm if still wanted."_
   - A pattern that appears **only recently** is worth capturing even with fewer occurrences. New conventions
     are exactly the ones nobody has written down yet.
   - If human and agent reviewers **disagree** on the same point, surface it rather than picking a side — an
     unresolved disagreement is a convention that was never actually settled.

**If few or no review comments are found** (e.g., PRs are self-merged or auto-merged), expand the search to up to 20 merged PRs. If there are still no review patterns, note this in the findings: _"No PR review patterns found — consider adding conventions as the team grows."_ Never silently skip this section.

These mined conventions go into `AGENTS.md`, where every tool reads them.

## 0d. Community health gap mapping

GitHub's community health API tells you exactly what's missing. Map it to the assets this skill generates:

| GitHub says missing | Skill generates |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| No issue templates | `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` (Step 6) |
| No pull request template | `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` (Step 6) |
| No CONTRIBUTING guide | README Contributing section (Step 7) |
| No CODE_OF_CONDUCT | Can suggest adding one |
| No license | Flag in the report |
| No README | Flag in the report |
